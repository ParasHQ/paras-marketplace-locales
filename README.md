## Paras is a great NFT market project built on NEAR.

As the Paras community grows globally, https://new.paras.id/ needs to support multiple languages, including:

- Thai (th)
- Vietnamese (vi) - [IN PROGRESS]
- Chinese (ch) 
- Russian (ru) - [IN PROGRESS]
- Korean (ko)
- French (fr) - [COMPLETED]

We need to refactor the frontend source code to enable the multi-language feature GitHub - ParasHQ/paras-marketplace-locales and make it easy to translate strings with i18n JSON strings.

## Context

Paras' user interface now only supports English. With more communities joining, it's important to provide UI in native languages for users from different countries and regions.

## Acceptance Criteria

The translator must create a pull request to GitHub - ParasHQ/paras-marketplace-locales. Please put the translations inside {language-code}/ . e.g. for Korean it will be ko/

The translation must cover all string values inside every JSON files in en/
